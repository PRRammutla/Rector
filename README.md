# Rector

Hi Strategic dimensions! My name is Poeletso Rammutla, also known as Rector. 
I prefer being called Rector becouse of people cant pronounce my Sepedi name correcly istate they say Puseletso. 
As you know miss pronouncing someone's name is an offence or disrespect. 
I will allow those who want to try using Poeletso to make mistakes while they are still getting the pronoucation correct.
